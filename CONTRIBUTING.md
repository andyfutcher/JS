## How to contribute to Main JS:

#### **Have you found a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.mainjs.org/issues). Before reporting a bug, it's crucial to verify that the issue hasn't already been identified and reported. You can do this by searching existing issues on the project's GitHub Issues page. This helps prevent duplicate reports and ensures efficient use of developer time.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.mainjs.org/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you feel you have a solution that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub [Issues](https://github.mainjs.org/issues). If you have developed a solution to an existing bug, or believe you have a fix, please open a new issue on the GitHub Issues page. When submitting your solution, ensure the **title begins with the prefix "SOLUTION"** and is followed by a clear, short description of the fix. Include all relevant information that would aid in understanding and implementing your solution.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* It's important to note that the Main JS project primarily targets JavaScript 2015 (ES6) for maximum compatibility and broad support. Therefore, contributions in this area should adhere to the ES6 standard.

#### **Looking for a feature or adding changes an existing one?**

* Suggest your feature in the Main JS [Discussions](https://github.mainjs.org/discussions) and suggest some Javascript. 

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

* The project maintains its target of JavaScript 2015 (ES6) for core compatibility. While personal hydration scripts and individual projects may utilize any ECMA script standard of your choice, contributions to the Main JS project itself should aim for ES6 as the minimum supported standard.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use Main JS [Discussions](https://github.mainjs.org/discussions).

* For any questions regarding the usage of Main JS or inquiries about the source code, please utilize the [Main JS](https://mainjs.org) website. This provides a dedicated space for community interaction and support, allowing for open dialogue and shared knowledge.

* Thank you to everyone who contributes to making Main JS a better project.
