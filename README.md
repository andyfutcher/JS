### About the developer
Copyright (C) 2025 **Andy Futcher**, I am the developer and maintainer of Main JS and Main HTML project and professional analyst at a not-for-profit health insurer.

Main JS is free and open source and will always be, my goal is to give everyone possible a first class ticket to the most well known and well-written markup language on earth; HTML. This is not just because of the projects chosen licence (GPLv3,) but it's a commitment to remain impartial and community focused and to never sell out or steer Main JS away from the core focus of portability and maintainability.
